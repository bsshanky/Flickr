### Note to reviewers:

I have covered all the features listed in the Acceptance Criteria. In the Extra Credit, I was able to fetch the image dimensions. I am planning to work on the other extra credit features post submission. Thank you for the opportunity to work on this project!

Edit 1:

I've added the support for the landscape orientation throughout the app.
